# Tableau Dashboards - Customizing

## Introduction
Until now we have been using the workbook in Tableau and getting used to the interface. Now we will take your Tableau skills one step further and dive into one of the most useful features of Tableau, the _Dashboard_. We will make a few vizzes and add them into a dashboard and learn how to arrange and customize the dashboard so the necessary data is featured. We will then explore some of the interactive objects and see how they can be used to allow the viewer to change the view to their needs.

## Objectives
You will be able to: 
* Create and format both horizontal and vertical containers
* Locate and use each of the dashboard objects available
* Add interactive elements to the dashboard

## Creating a Dashboard
The first step in creating a _Dashboard_ is to open a blank dashboard. There are two ways to do this:
* __The Menu Bar__ - In the menu bar at the top of the interface you will see __Dashboard__. Click on this drop down and you will see the options for _Dashboard_. Your first option should be __New Dashboard__, click on this option and you will be taken to a new, blank dashboard.
* __New Dashboard__ tab at the bottom of the interface. To the right of the _New Worksheet_ tab, you will find the _New Dashboard_ icon, click on this icon and you will be taken to a new, blank dashboard.

## Containers
_Containers_ are Tableau's way of assigning and formatting a space for elements of your dashboard. There are two types of containers: _Horizontal_ and, you guessed it, _Vertical_. To create a container you will simply drag either the _Horizontal_ or _Vertical_ container into the workspace. Once you have a container, you will want to drag and drop the sheet you want from the _Sheets_ list to the left of the interface.

## Device Type
In todays business environment, there are multiple platforms for interacting with software, and Tableau did not leave this to chance. At the top of the _Dashboard Pane_ you will see the default device layout selected, which may already be __Phone__. You will likely want to add another view such as _Desktop_, which can be done with the menu at the top of the interface, by clicking on __Dashboard>Device Layouts>Add Desktop__. This option lets you see what your dashboard will look like on different devices, so you can ensure it will be visible. You can even customize the view for each device format. If you want to remove a device, you can hover over it on the _Dashboard Pane_ and click on the `...` and you will find the options for that device layout including _Delete Layout_.

## Other Objects
There are some very useful _Objects_ provided by Tableau that allow you to add many useful components to your dashboard. Below is a list of a few of them.
